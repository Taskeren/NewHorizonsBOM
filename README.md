# NewHorizonsBOM

A project to generate Maven BOM (Bill of Materials) for GTNH Modpack.

This is useful to the addon developers to follow the modpack versions.
For example, you want to provide support for GTNH v2.7.4, you don't have to find the mod versions that v2.7.4 uses,
instead, you can include the BOM generated by this project, and the versions are assigned for you by the BOM.

## Usage Gradle

```
repositories {
  // ...
  maven {
      url = uri("https://taskeren.github.io/NewHorizonsBOM")
  }
  // ...
}

dependencies {
  // ...
  implementation(platform("com.github.GTNewHorizons:gtnh-bom:MODPACK_VERSION"))
  // ...
}
```

The Modpack version can be found in [Manifests in DreamAssemblerXXL](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/DreamAssemblerXXL/tree/master/releases/manifests).
For example, if there is a `2.7.3.json`, there should be a `com.github.GTNewHorizons:gtnh-bom:2.7.3`.

The supported dependencies can be viewed at the main page of the site.
